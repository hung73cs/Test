1. Printer Area
   - The component should expand to fill the right-side space (width 100%).
   - The select box and button are not aligned properly.

2. Print Range Area
   - It should be named "Page range" instead of "Print range"
   - "Current view" is unnecessary as it duplicates the meaning of "Current page"
   - "All" and "Current page" should not be checked simultaneously.
   - "Page from" and "Pages" share the same functionality; it's preferable to choose one (preferably "Pages").
   - The "Subset" title and select box should be aligned at the bottom for consistency with other components.

3. Print Handling
   - The select boxes for "page scaling," "arrange," and "rotate" should have the same size.
   - Checked item do not have the title.
   - The distance between the three select boxes and the "checked" button is too wide.

4. Print What
   - There is too much space between the title and the select box, which is inconsistent with other components.
   - Duplicate Print as Grayscale

5. Preview
   - The preview size mismatches with the configured numbers, specifically "1.5 & 8.5"
   - Zoom in/out is missing the "-" symbol.
   - "Previos/Next" is missing the "Next" button.
   - The units are inconsistent, using "cm" and "in"

6. Action Buttons
   - The "Cancel" button is missing, it may be helpful to include an "Apply" button.
   - The "OK" button should be moved closer to the bottom-right corner.

7. Window
   - There is a lack of "close" and "minimize" buttons.
   - The layout is inconsistent, both within the same section and between the title and select boxes.

8. Common Logic
   - "Print range" displays as "1-195," but the "Preview" shows "1-193," resulting in a mismatch.
